# WFPStarterKit

This repository contains <a href="https://github.com/JaredWright/WFPStarterKit/tree/master/WFPStarterKit">source code</a> for an example driver along with a <a href="https://github.com/JaredWright/WFPStarterKit/tree/master/Tutorial">tutorial</a> that collectively show how to set-up some basic components of the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP).
The WFP is a kernel level Windows API that allows you develop drivers that provide networking functionality beyond the scope of any libraries provided by Microsoft.
This powerful framework is essentially a tool kit for creaing networking rootkits on Windows, or for changing how Windows provides networking capabilities to all applications running in userspace.
Even though this framework is very powerful, documentation for using (let alone getting started) with the WFP is currently nonexistent in my opinion.
This repository aims to help others get to "Hello World" with the WFP, and bootstrap your knowledge to a point where you will be able to (bravely) start making any sense of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366510(v=vs.85).aspx">Microsoft's documentation</a> for this tool.
